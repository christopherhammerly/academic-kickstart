Since I have switched over my website, I received a request to make my previous blog posts regarding the open letter to the LSA from Summer 2020. Here is both my original post entitled "Thoughts on the open letter to the LSA", originally posted on July 8th, 2020, followed by a post entitled "A response to a journalist" first posted on July 27th, 2020. 

Thoughts on the open letter to the LSA

I do not agree with the positions that Dr. Steven Pinker has repeatedly and publicly taken. He has shown an inability to listen, learn, and place facts in their proper context. He has, without a reasonable claim to ignorance, minimized the violence imposed by racist systems. Violence that has transformed with equal malice from slavery, to segregation, to police brutality and mass incarceration; from treaties, to genocide, to reservations, to forced assimilation and termination. This violence has not been recognized or repaired with the same systematicity with which it is has been inflicted.

Being a public figure within linguistics, Dr. Pinker has done damage to our collective reputations. I understand the petition to remove him from the media contact list of the LSA. I do not wish to be represented by him either. I understand the desire to revoke his fellowship status. I do not wish to honor him either. He has violated the stated morals of the LSA as well as my own.

Why have I not signed the letter? In short, I agree with the moral stance, but disagree with the method. I agree with the characterization of Dr. Pinker’s statements that the letter puts forward. I think that the LSA should carefully review their choice to direct the media his way and evaluate whether he should continue to be honored with fellowship status. But I think any action taken must be backed up by the power granted through a measured and transparent due process. That is what I believe is right for all people, regardless of the situation. I will not equivocate on what I think is right, but I believe that justice is a process rather than an event. I do not feel that the letter and the conversation it has spawned makes room for a process of justice.

As a result, I have serious doubts that progress will be made as a result of the rebuke as it is currently unfolding. It has made Dr. Pinker exactly what he wants to be: a martyr and a victim. It has played into his hand. For someone like Dr. Pinker, I think the best course of action is for each of us to boost voices other than his. To craft counterarguments. To represent who we are as linguists with our own thoughts. Our arguments are bound to be stronger. The evidence is in our favor. Alas, we will likely not convince him or those like him to see the world in a different way, but at least we can hope to change the minds of those who may be on the fence about what to make of this moment and our history.

I think that the open letter was created from a well-intentioned place. I imagine the writers agonizing over their words (just as I am right now) and looking for a way to make a difference within the field. The vitriol with which the letter has been received in many circles has been appalling. I have been saddened to see some members of the field retreat to a defense of Dr. Pinker, rather than an acceptance of what his statements represent and promote. I have also been dismayed by the way in which some who are promoting the letter have attacked those who reasonably dissent or have chosen not to sign.

I hope that we can be better as a field and as a society. That we can get to the point where recognition and reparations for the wide range of historical and present injustices are made. For the moment, I hope to spark thoughtful conversation. To learn by revealing my thoughts and experience, and listening to what is reflected back. I expect that I am misguided in some way that I cannot yet see, but I have tried my best given what I know. I like to think that most of you are doing the same.
